## Hello, I am Elif Yılmaz! 👋

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Neuchatel, Switzerland.

I received my BSc degree in Primary Mathematics Education and my MSc degree in Computational Science and Engineering from Boğaziçi University, Turkey. My master’s thesis was about “[Short-term Forecast Methodologies](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=qVqOZFj2DwNmvdf1oGFYiNVa87wIIBf5zByl7jQFtF29p6cfiQrQFFbSu-EjVTEn)” on large traffic flow datasets. 

Moreover, I worked as a machine learning engineer and a data scientist on the various projects concerning subjects such as image processing, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
