## Hello, I am Elif YÄ±lmaz! ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Neuchatel, Switzerland.

I received my BSc degree in Primary Mathematics Education and my MSc degree in Computational Science and Engineering from BoÄŸaziÃ§i University, Turkey. My masterâ€™s thesis was about [Short-term Forecast Methodologies and Case Studies in Traffic Flow](https://tez.yok.gov.tr/UlusalTezMerkezi/TezGoster?key=qVqOZFj2DwNmvdf1oGFYiNVa87wIIBf5zByl7jQFtF29p6cfiQrQFFbSu-EjVTEn).

Moreover, I worked as a machine learning engineer and a data scientist on the various projects concerning subjects such as image processing, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing.
